(Only a few "user stories" away from implemetation
by now, so you might as well read it and get a little
bit of advance warning.)


### Urban fantasy

Rook](http://www.rookfiles.com/).  Woman awakens in
park, in a rainstorm, with no memory of her previous
life or career.  Turns out that she's in a book

### Sufficiently Advanced Magic

Andrew Rowe's [Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB) Five years ago, Corin Cadence’s brother entered the Serpent Spire — a colossal tower with ever-shifting rooms, traps, and monsters. Those who survive the spire’s trials return home with an attunement: a mark granting the bearer magical powers. According to legend, those few who reach the top of the tower will be granted a boon by the spire’s goddess.
